# Hello hello!

I'm Amandeep, a graphic design student who is passionate (but still learning) about making good design and hopefully leaving a impression on someone.

I got a <a href="https://amandeepchandan.com/">website</a>! (which is work in progress). Besides that, I get easily distracted by other projects and hobbies within my life.

## Finding me elsewhere on the web ðŸŒŽ:

- Occasionally posting my works on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amandeep_s_chandan/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/deepsc">Behance</a>
- Lurking on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmandeepChandan">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandeep-chandan00/">LinkedIn<a/>

###### If you ever need to contact me or just wish to chat about anything, send me an email @ <amandeepchandan00@gmail.com>

## Any fun facts ðŸ¤”?
- I have a kazzo
- I can fold a mean origami swan 
- I love peanut butter
